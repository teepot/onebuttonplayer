The One Button Service Player is a simple to operate MP3 Player.

## Things to know:

1. There is no on/off button, but there is a reset button near the LEDs. A single press of the reset button will engage the reset process.
2. If you need to plug it in or press the reset button it will take about 30 seconds or so for the red LED to come on, which indicates the player is ready to receive a USB stick.
3. Keep it plugged in.
4. When the red LED is lit, it is ready to play and this LED should always be on.
5. If the red LED is lit and the green LED is lit, it is playing.
6. If the red LED is lit and green LED is flashing, playback is paused.
7. It will cease playing when it gets to the end of the service.
8. It won't work properly if there is more than one USB stick plugged into it.
9. The unit looks at the each file's file system date and will play the most current one. You don't have to worry about deleting older MP3s.

## How to set it up:

1. Make sure that the red LED is lit. If it isn't, make sure it is plugged in properly. If it is plugged in properly try the reset button.
2. Make sure that sound system jack is plugged into the unit.
3. Remove any USB sticks. If the green LED is lit or flashing you may have to reset the unit.
4. Make sure the red LED is lit and insert the new USB stick.
5. It is now setup to play.

## How to play:

1. To PLAY: Press the Easy button. You should hear sound coming out of the sound system and the green LED is now lit. 
2. To PAUSE: Press the Easy button. Playback should be paused and the green LED should be flashing.
3. To UN-PAUSE: Press the Easy button. Playback should resume through the sound system where it left off and the green LED should be lit and not flashing.
4. Playback will cease when it comes to the end of the MP3 file. The green LED will turn off.

## Troubleshooting and known issues:

1. If the red LED is not on, check to see if the unit is plugged in properly. If it is plugged in, then press the reset and it will reboot, which may take about 30 seconds or so.
2. The Easy button can be a little slow. Give it at least 10 seconds to respond to a press. If the player does not respond to a press within 10 seconds, press the Easy button again.
3. Some cheap (as in quality) USB sticks have been known not to work with the unit. We tested it with one of the one's that Fred bought and it worked OK.
